    "### **Agent Communication on Azure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent communication is a crucial component of the multi-agent system, enabling seamless collaboration between agents and ensuring efficient task execution. Azureâ€™s communication services, such as **Azure Service Bus** for message passing and **Blob Storage/Cosmos DB** for shared memory, ensure robust, scalable, and asynchronous interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Message Passing**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "Message passing is implemented using **Azure Service Bus**, a fully managed enterprise messaging service. It enables asynchronous communication between agents, ensuring decoupled workflows and efficient task coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Azure Service Bus Features for Agent Communication**\n",
    "1. **Queues**:\n",
    "   - Ensures one-to-one communication between agents.\n",
    "   - Messages are stored in a queue until the receiving agent is ready to process them.\n",
    "   - Example Use:\n",
    "     - The Problem Parser Agent sends a parsed problem description to the Computational Strategy Designer Agent via a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Topics and Subscriptions**:\n",
    "   - Facilitates one-to-many communication where multiple agents can subscribe to a single topic.\n",
    "   - Example Use:\n",
    "     - The Implementation Agent publishes execution results to a topic, and both the Feedback Loop and Visualization agents consume the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dead Letter Queues**:\n",
    "   - Captures undeliverable or expired messages for later review and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Workflow Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Message Structure**\n",
    "- Messages are formatted in **JSON** to ensure interoperability between agents.\n",
    "- Example Message from Problem Parser Agent:\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"taskId\": \"parse01\",\n",
    "    \"agent\": \"ComputationalStrategyDesigner\",\n",
    "    \"payload\": {\n",
    "      \"description\": \"Optimize delivery routes using quantum computing.\",\n",
    "      \"algorithm_type\": \"QAOA\",\n",
    "      \"performance_metrics\": {\n",
    "        \"execution_time\": \"10 minutes\",\n",
    "        \"accuracy\": \"95%\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"timestamp\": \"2024-12-07T14:32:00Z\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Message Processing**\n",
    "1. **Sender Agent**:\n",
    "   - Publishes a message to the appropriate Service Bus queue or topic.\n",
    "   - Example: The Problem Parser Agent sends a structured task to the Computational Strategy Designer Agent.\n",
    "2. **Service Bus**:\n",
    "   - Stores the message until the receiver is ready.\n",
    "   - Ensures reliable delivery through retries and dead-letter queues.\n",
    "3. **Receiver Agent**:\n",
    "   - Listens for messages from the queue or subscribes to a topic.\n",
    "   - Processes the message and performs the required task.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Asynchronous Execution**\n",
    "- Service Bus decouples agents, allowing them to operate independently.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - If the Computational Strategy Designer Agent is busy, the Service Bus retains the message until the agent becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages of Azure Service Bus**\n",
    "- **Reliability**:\n",
    "  - Guarantees message delivery even during network interruptions or agent downtime.\n",
